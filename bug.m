In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing issue can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, especially when dealing with weak references.  If an observed object is deallocated while an observer is still registered, it can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior. This is particularly subtle because the observer might not immediately notice the object's demise, leading to delayed and difficult-to-debug errors.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyObservedClass *observedObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
  // ... handle KVO notification ...
  // If observedObject is deallocated, this method might still be called
  // leading to a crash if you try to access properties of observedObject
}
@end
```

The `weak` reference to `observedObject` prevents retain cycles, but if `observedObject` is deallocated before the KVO observer is removed, accessing any of its properties within `observeValueForKeyPath:` will result in a crash.
